# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO ðŸ“šðŸ”—

Welcome to the "0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO" project! In this module, you will delve into the concepts of stacks and queues in C programming. You will learn about their distinct characteristics as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures, respectively.

## Learning Objectives ðŸŽ¯

Upon completion of this project, you'll have the knowledge to explain the following topics to others, without the need for external references:

### General ðŸ’¡

#### Understanding Stacks and Queues
Grasp the fundamental concepts of stacks and queues as data structures, their specific behavior, and the key differences between them.

#### Sharing Variables with `extern`
Explore how to utilize the `extern` keyword to share variables between different source files in C programming.

#### Stack Operations
Discover the operations associated with stacks, including push and pop, and comprehend their importance in managing data using the LIFO approach.

#### Queue Operations
Learn about the operations associated with queues, such as enqueue and dequeue, and their significance in maintaining data with the FIFO strategy.
